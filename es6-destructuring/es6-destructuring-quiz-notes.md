## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  allows us to take out pieces of data from objects/arrays and store them as variables to use them more conveniently

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  let { prop1: var1, prop2: var2 } = obj;

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  let [index1, index2, index3] = array;
  let [, , index3] = array;

- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  creating object/array would assign the object/array name to and object/array, which places the variable on the left and expression on the right of the assignment operator. Destructuring assigns object/arrays to an obj/array name, which places the obj/array expression on the left and the variable name on the right of the assignment operator
